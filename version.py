"""
Which state of Startup Launcher is running, derived from the commit history.

Nobody raises this number by hand, so it cannot be forgotten and cannot lie. It
works the same way as in the other projects (Mint Cleaner, Branchly):

    major  raised by hand, and only for a release that genuinely justifies it
    minor  number of commits that added a new module under ui/ or services/
           (``__init__.py`` aside), which is where a new capability lands:
           a dialog, the single-instance lock, the startup log
    patch  commits since that last happened
    build  total number of commits

So "0.4.6 (17)" means: the 17th commit, the fourth time a module arrived, six
changes since then. Alongside it stand the short hash of the last commit and
its date, read from the same history, so a number in a bug report can be traced
back to an exact commit.

A new module is the threshold because it is a defensible one. Counting commits
whose title begins with "Add" runs away, because a title style that says "Add"
for a column width as readily as for a new capability makes the second digit
rise every other day until it means nothing. A feature built over several
commits counts once, at the commit that brings its module, and several modules
in one commit count once as well. The anchor is the first commit: the initial
import brought the whole application and counts as the first arrival, so the
first working state is 0.1.x. Renamed modules are not new ones. Everything else
is the third digit, and two digits there are fine.

One source, three routes to it, tried in this order:

    STARTUP_LAUNCHER_VERSION       a fixed value, for tests and for a one-off run
    git history                    a checkout, which is every development machine
    VERSION file                   an installation without .git, and the
                                   single-file executable, which carries it

The VERSION file is written whenever the history is read, and after every commit
by ``.githooks/post-commit``. It is not checked in: it is derived, and a
checked-in copy would be stale one commit later. The executable never reads git
and never writes the file: its copy was written by ``build-exe.py`` and lives in
a temporary directory.

There is deliberately no invented fallback such as 0.0.0. A made-up number looks
real and sends every bug report in the wrong direction, so an unknown version
says so.

This module deliberately imports nothing from Startup Launcher. The commit
hook runs it on its own, before anything else is importable, and the commands it
runs are fixed, read only, and only ever point at Startup Launcher's own
folder.
